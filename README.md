## A simple algorithm for making doodles.
This example is meant to give you (presumably students in my CIN360H1-S17: Media, Technology, Control course) a fairly high-level understanding of the relationship between code and behavior: source vs. runtime, scriptural vs. executable, essence vs. appearance, logos vs. manifestation.

Also, it's damn mesmerizing.

### A technical note.
My strategies for making the source code readable mean that this might not work, or work well, in older browsers. You should be good in recent versions of Chrome and Safari, but YMMV if you last updated your browser more than a year ago or are using Microsoft produces (which I encourage you to avoid doing).
